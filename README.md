# Isospectralization in PyTorch

## Introduction

This is an implementation for the paper "Isospectralization, or how to hear shape, style, and correspondence [1]" in PyTorch.

## Set up the environment

We recommend to use `pipenv` for environment setup. Please make sure that `pipenv` is properly installed (if not, try `pip install pipenv`), then run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies.

## Run

To run your code: python test.py 

## TODO

- [ ] Experiment complex shapes in ShapeNet
- [ ] Reproduce style transfer results
- [ ] Reproduce nonisometric shape matching results (need to implement another model, so perhaps leave this for last)
- [ ] Improve CLI (possibly using argparse)
