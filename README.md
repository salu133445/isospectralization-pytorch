# Isospectralization in PyTorch

## Introduction

This is an implementation for the paper "Isospectralization, or how to hear shape, style, and correspondence [1]" in PyTorch.

## Set up the environment

We recommend to use `pipenv` for environment setup. Please make sure that `pipenv` is properly installed (if not, try `pip install pipenv`), then run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies.
